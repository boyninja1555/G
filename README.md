# G - An alternative to X (originally known as Twitter)
Say goodbye to the nightmares of X (originally known as Twitter). Even though there is a closely resembling name to X, you can forget that with the many perks of using G over X. See the READEME file for more details.

## Project Structure (For Contributors)
**Note:** The `Backend` and `Frontend` folders cannot be run together. Instead, the frontend is a seperate Next.js server for serving the UI and the backend is a NodeJS server holding a file-stored "database" and API routes such as posting, reading a post, creating an account, etc.

```structure
|-- Backend\
|--|-- src\
|--|--|-- *etc*
|--|-- .env
|--|-- package.json
|--|-- tsconfig.json
|-- Frontend\
|--|-- *etc*
|-- .gitignore
|-- LICENSE
